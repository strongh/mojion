mojion
======

Clojure interface to Leap Motion, via the the WebSocket API. WIP. Closest thing to docs is the `mojion.example` namespace.

The motivation is that [clojure-leap](https://github.com/ohpauleez/clojure-leap) seemed cool but it depends on an unhosted jar and JNI. This project doesn't, so may a bit easier to integrate into other projects.
